## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Trunomi seeks to solve the issue of global privacy governance and laws for its clients which are businesses.
Trunomi protects businesses, companies, brands and their customers by providing guidance on all Data Privacy Regulations globally.
The problem more specifically for businesses is to ensure that they are compliant with all laws in any jurisdiction and for customers of these businesses
who wish to trust the company's product or service with their personal data. Trunomi seeks to make privacy a competitive advantage for its clients.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Trunomi's intended customers are companies/businesses of any size and from all sectors that require solutions around data and privacy. 
Trunomi is agnostic to the types of data, regulations and legal bases under which businesses process personal data. 
It's able to be deployed anywhere in the world and across any business. Due to the large scale and wide applications of Trunomi across many sectors, 
the market size is difficult to determine.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Trunomi's technology is patented and scalable which provides the company with an advantage over competitors. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Trunomi uses Microservices, Kubernetes and serverless functions. Trunomi runs on all modern cloud systems as well as AWS and Azure.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Trunomi is in the RegTech domain of Fintech

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Regtech is becoming increasingly deployed on cloud with innovative cloud-based services and niche deliveries beginning to emerge.
Regtech is also evolving into a means of offering profitable, tax-efficient investment advice.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Some of the other companies in the Regtech domain are:
- IndentifyMind global

Trunomi was named in the RegTech 100 for 2019, which is an annual list of 100 of the world's most innovative RegTech companies selected
by a panel of industry experts. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
As with all companies some core metrics for Trunomi relate to revenue, profit, scale and adoption. Trunomi is a privately held company and does not
trade on any exchanges, due to this accessing financial data/board reports etc. is difficult with information available online varying and not being entirely reliable.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Trunomi is recognised as a market leader in its subfield within RegTech, as per above it is difficult to assess the company's performance 
relative to competitors due to the lack of accurate financial data.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would recommend the trunomi creates a marketing campaign to target their clients' customers.
For Trunomi their clients are business that wish to ensure compliance with data regulations and laws. However, there is also a great
deal of interest from everyday consumers and customers in how their data is stored and used. This topic has become increasingly discussed
in the media and society and was highlighted in the 2016 US Presidential Election where there was controversy around data manipulation and storage
to influence votes, the company at the centre of this was Cambridge Analytica. The issue of BigTech data storage and usage was then the subject of multiple
senate inquiries and analysis by media commentators which thrust this issue into the spotlight. More recently in the 2020 US Presidential Election there
was more controversy around personal data use and manipulation by "Big Tech" companies. Netflix also created a documentary titled "The Social Dilemma" which shone a light
on how our data is used and stored. For the above reasons personal data use is a trending topic and on the minds of most consumers in the market.
Based on the above I would advise Trunomi to create a marketing campaign for their consumers which centres around raising awareness that businesses
which use Trunomi's products are safe and trustworthy i.e. if a business does NOT use Trunomi a consumer should not trust the business. This will
result in businesses approaching Trunomi as they want to be seen as compliant and trustworthy in the eyes of their customers. The product specifically would be 
a business tool or scale whereby businesses could grade themselves for e.g. a 'Trunomi Trust Scale' which they can display to their customers
which allows the customer to then trust the business. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
It would benefit the company because it would raise awareness of their business amongst the population and provide a positive feedback loop, whereby consumers approach
businesses and ask if they use Trunomi products to protect their data.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
There would not be any additional technologies needed for this product/service, it would be well within the scope of technology and capabilities that Trunomi already has.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
N/A
